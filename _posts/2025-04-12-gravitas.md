After a *slight* (and, as it turns out, completely unnecessary) breakdown over something work-related last week, my dad recommended that I read the book [*Gravitas: The 8 Strengths That Redefine Confidence*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123382604-gravitas?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=bsMSMnIpXE&rank=2) by Lisa Sun.

Having finished it, it’s now very clear why he suggested it to me. In my opinion, the core message of the book is this: confidence doesn’t not have a single definition. It varies drastically from person to person, and even within a person, depending on the season of life they’re in. More importantly, it’s not something you’re either born with or not. With intention and effort, confidence can be developed, refined, and strengthened over time.  

Confidence can mean a variety of things, and is expressed differently in different people. Even though I don’t jump for joy at the idea of giving a big presentation, that doesn’t take away from the fact that I am still a strong, confident woman.

For me, confidence shows up in the way I achieve. I take pride in my ambition, drive, and competitiveness. These traits help me set and reach big goals, and with every achievement, my confidence grows. When I accomplish something I’ve worked hard for, it reinforces that I’m not just capable, I’m worthy of success too. While some people take pride in accomplishing things with little effort, I take pride in the effort, in doing a job thoroughly and doing it well. My work ethic makes me dependable, and I’m proud of the fact that people can count on me to get things done.

That said, there are several of the strengths that I want to grow into. For starters, performing is certainly not an area I (currently) excel in. I don’t love public speaking, and it often takes courage (and a mini pep-talk) for me to present in front of large audiences. This is a strength I am committing to improving upon, even though it will likely be a painful, uncomfortable process. 

Some specific tasks I want to hold myself accountable to in order to achieve (😉) this goal include: 

- Speaking up with confidence in meetings, especially when I feel “less than”
- Volunteering to present in larger settings
- Practicing speaking with more intention and charisma

I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially to women like myself who have been told they “lack” confidence. In most cases, that simply isn’t true, and it’s likely a reflection of someone else’s insecurities being projected onto you. If you work in a male-dominated space and have ever felt isolated or “different,” this book might resonate with you as well. Your differences don’t make you less confident, you just express confidence in your own, unique way.

I took a lot from this book, and funny enough, I finished it feeling more confident than when I started. Great read.
