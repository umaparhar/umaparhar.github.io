As the mid-year mark rolled around, I took some time to reflect on how 2025 has gone so far (my goals, what I’ve learned, what I want to stop or keep doing in the second half of the year..etc). As I did this, a bunch of themes and patterns really stood out to me. Honestly, I could spend an entire week unpacking each of them, but for time’s sake, I decided to pick three of my favorites to dive deeper into here. Hopefully, I’ll get to the rest in future posts.

### 1. Learn when YOU work best

This one has been huge for me, and it’s genuinely transformed how I approach my days. I’ve known my entire life that I’m 100% a morning person. My brain is clearest and most focused right when I wake up, so I make sure my most important, high-focus work happens then. I take the earliest bus to the office just so I can take full advantage of those sacred hours.

On the flip side, I know for a fact that nothing productive is happening for me after 9 p.m. My brain shuts off, and words start spinning. So instead of fighting it, I save the lower-brainpower tasks like budgeting, cleaning, or life admin for the evening. I usually throw on a podcast or some music, and weirdly, it feels kind of therapeutic. It’s like giving my brain permission to shut down.

I know not everyone is wired this exact way (honestly most people I know are the exact opposite and thrive late at night). If that’s you, lean into it! The key is figuring out your prime working hours and building your schedule around them. Don’t force yourself into someone else’s rhythm, optimize for when YOU thrive!

### 2. Being like your parents isn’t (usually) a bad thing

I know a lot of people who want to be the opposite of their parents. For me, it’s the total reverse, I’d be honored to turn out like mine. My parents are the first people I go to when I’m scared, excited, stressed, or just want to chat.

Even though we live far apart now, I try to make an intentional effort to stay close to them. It's so easy to let relationships slip when everyone is busy and scattered across the country, and it takes a lot of effort not to let this happen. I admire them deeply, and I’m so grateful for the role they continue to play in my life. It’s a relationship I’ll always choose and one I hope to keep putting time and energy into nurturing.

### 3. Pain + Reflection = Progress

This one is a newer mindset shift for me, and it came from something Ray Dalio said in a MasterClass series called *“Mastering the Markets.”* As soon as I heard it, I paused the video and wrote it down:

Pain + Reflection = Progress.

It's not mind-blowing or anything new, but it really stuck with me. And even though I know it’s true, I’m still actively working on believing it in real time. When I mess up or feel like I’ve failed, it’s really easy for me to start spiraling. But when I look back, it’s clear that my biggest moments of growth came because I made a mistake, reflected on it, and learned.

The reflection part is key. Without that piece, pain is just pain. But when you sit with it, try to understand it, and take something away from it, that’s where the magic happens. That’s when progress and growth actually begins. I think. I’m honestly still trying to convince myself of it...
