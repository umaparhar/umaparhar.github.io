Hello! my name is Uma, and I'm a current Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on CloudPKI and Resource Access for Microsoft Intune.

Outside of work, I love listening to podcasts, working on creative side projects, doing Pilates, exploring new coffee shops, and going on long walks.

### My story

Coming soon
